Back on track!

Had a lot of fun making these, modeling the snow was more freestyle than other models I made.
I even had time to make a smaller version, a baby snowman. I think with some different colors he could also look a little bit like a penguin.

I wanted to give the snowmen a snow texture and a scarf texture, but for some reason they looked completely messed up. I made a UV map in Blender and tried many different settings in Unity but nevertheless it kept looking weird and stretchy.

I got a new mechanic pencil for my birthday and it's great. I used it for sketching some snowmen.

I used the following images as a reference, the first for the big snowman, the second for the small one.

The snow was made with a particle!
