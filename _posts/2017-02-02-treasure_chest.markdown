I spent way too much time on this asset ðŸ™€
The modeling itself didn't take very long, but I spent a lot of time figuring out animation, texturing and creating particles.
I even learnt how to make hand painted textures, but find out it would take even more time :')

I am proud of my sparkles particle effect though ðŸ˜Œ âœ¨

Going to submit this to the asset store, and I really hope it gets accepted!

Next up: a snowman!

This was the reference I based my model on

The animation and particle effect was made in Unity

The sprite for the particle I made myself in [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) (an open source photoshop-like tool)
