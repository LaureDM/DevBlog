I recently started this new routine where I would start a new 3D project every week and work on it 7 days. When those 7 days are over I have to post the work online, no matter what.
So this is the first outcome of that routine, a simple and ordinary jar.
I had some trouble with the glass texture, wich I'm still not happy about. The jar looks simple but it was challenging to go from the 6-sides jar to the rounder 12-side top.

Here are some more images of my work.
