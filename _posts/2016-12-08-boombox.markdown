This week I worked on a Boombox (I worked one day longer than I should have worked :s)

I'm quite happy with the result although I could've put more work into the texturing and finishing touches. But I ran out of time so I kinda stopped working on the details.
The buttons on top of the radio were supposed to have some more details on them (I was going to design textures) but in the end I thought it wouldn't make a big difference anyway. Maybe I'll retexture it in the future.

I learned a lot of new Blender tools making this! For example the knife tool to cut out the smaller squares here and there. Also the 'Dissolve Faces' is something I discovered during this project and I think it's great.
It's great for having less faces after a subdivide or extend. I used it to clean up my faces when the Boombox was finished.
Another blender thing I learned was the "bridge edge loops", I used to do that manually before. Saved me some clicking work!
Finally I learned how to apply textures and UV map them. Glad I sat through some tutorials because it isn't difficult at all. I used to avoid textures ðŸ˜¬

It is a little less lowpoly than I usually go for!
